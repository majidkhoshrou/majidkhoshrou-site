    "abstract": "In a world replete with observations (physical as well as virtual), many data sets are represented by time series. In its simplest form, a time series is a set of data collected sequentially, usually at fixed intervals of time. In a number of applications, the mean and the variance of the time series is time-invariant and there is no seasonality in the data (such time series is called stationary). However, in many more applications, e.g., time series that are related to smart energy systems, the data have non-stationary characteristics. This thesis focuses primarily on matrices as an alternative representation of the latter type of time series, in order to take advantage of matrix decomposition methods. The rationale is straightforward: numerically stable matrix decomposition techniques enable us to extract underlying patterns in the data and use them to construct approximations of the corresponding time series. In particular, we will focus on singular value decomposition (SVD) as a powerful and numerically stable matrix factorization technique. Therefore, as the first step in this thesis, the SVD and its geometrical interpretation are extensively studied, in order to acquire a firm understanding of how it performs. That in turn enables us to look at different problems in time series analysis from a fresh perspective. For most of the applications of SVD in various fields, it is important to understand the properties of the SVD of a matrix whose entries show some degree of random fluctuations. Therefore, to determine how the noise level affects the singular value spectrum, it is essential to study the singular value decomposition of random matrices. As we will explain in the introductory chapter, one of the early applications of the SVD in time series analysis is in periodicity detection of the time series data. Therefore, we explore how the geometry of a matrix (the position of the data points with respect to the origin) and the aspect ratio of the matrix (the ratio between the number of columns and the number of rows) can affect its SVD results. Matrix factorisation techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are both conceptually simple and effective. However, it is well-known that they are sensitive to the presence of noise and outliers in input data. One way to mitigate this sensitivity is to introduce regularisation. To this aim, we hark back to the interpretation of SVD and PCA in terms of low-rank approximations, which involve the minimisation of specific functionals. We then derive algorithms for the minimisation of the regularised version of such functionals. After the above-described theoretical investigations of SVD, we considered novel applications of SVD to various problems. The first one concerned challenges related to the integration of renewable energy sources (RES). With increasing RES-integration such as wind and solar energy to the power grid, balancing the grid has become more challenging. This is mostly due to the inherently intermittent nature of RES, on the one hand, and shortcomings in bulk energy storage systems, on the other. Therefore, studies on scenario-based probabilistic energy production and demand forecasts have gained momentum, as they are highly valuable from both a technical and an economic point of view. A particular application of such models in the energy sector is where having the distribution of energy consumption for the coming days is desired. Furthermore, as extensively argued in the literature, a decisive variable in predicting energy demand is temperature data. There are mainly three practical and popular methods for generating temperature scenarios, namely fixed-date, shifted-date, and bootstrap approaches. Nevertheless, these methods have mostly been used on an ad-hoc basis without being formally compared or quantitatively evaluated. Moreover, as we discuss, the performance of such models depends to a large extent on the quality of input data. Therefore, we propose a generic, data-driven and computationally efficient SVD-based approach to simulate temperature scenarios. The strength of our proposed method lies in its simplicity and robustness, in terms of the training window size, with no need for subsetting or thresholding in order to generate temperature scenarios. The empirical case studies performed on the data from the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014-L) show that the proposed method outperforms the top two scenario-based models with a similar set-up. Another topic of considerable interest is to investigate what effect the transition of energy to RES can have on the overall trend and volatility of electricity prices. This impact could be complex because there are two contradicting forces at play. The marginal cost of RES is relatively low and even negative (especially if subsidized), therefore, increased penetration of wind and solar would result in a downward trend in electricity prices. Opposing this is the associated uncertainty regarding the availability of wind and solar energy, which causes spikes in the market. In other words, the integration of RES provokes assertions that the stability of the power grid can (surely) be compromised due to the inherent intermittency of such sources. Therefore, the increased price volatility will cause additional market risks for suppliers and consumers in the market. In the literature, numerous methods have been introduced to determine the volatility of the time series data. However, as we exemplify, the emergence of non-positive price values in the energy transition era has introduced new challenges in the electricity market volatility analysis. This new aspect of the market renders many traditional volatility indices ineffective. More precisely, the standard approach to switch to logarithmic measures can be done only after shifting up all values above zero by a certain threshold. On the other hand, price volatility has a dependence on the price level, which is even more pronounced when the spot prices are low. Therefore, the generalizability of conventional approaches is questioned, as the volatility measures can vary drastically, with respect to the magnitude of the aforementioned thresholds. We tackle this problem by introducing a new notion of volatility which is obtained by reconstructing the time series using the SVD technique. In other words, we detect and remove the deterministic part of the price data using the SVD and consider the stochastic part (residuals) as a notion of volatility. Using the matrix representation of the data, we then highlight the evidence of the effect of renewables on daily price profiles in the German day-ahead market, i.e., the emergence of non-positive prices and also shifts of peak price values to hours where solar is less available. Overall, in this thesis, we study in-depth the SVD technique and propose novel applications of it in time series analysis. Our findings can be used as innovative components of future smart grid systems, which are characterized by the increasing uncertainty on both the supply and demand parts."
