Powering Smarter Market Forecasts ‚Äî Day-Ahead Allocation at Alliander Since June 2024, I've been part of the Short-Term Energy Forecasts (STEF) team at Alliander, where I focus on improving allocation forecasts for the day-ahead energy market. By refining core models, fixing legacy bugs, and introducing high-impact predictors, I helped boost forecast accuracy by 30% ‚Äî leading to over ‚Ç¨1.3 million in annual cost savings. The outcomes of this work were integrated into OpenSTEF, Alliander's open-source forecasting library, enhancing its robustness and usability. This project directly supported the Market Services (Marketdiensten) team, enabling more data-driven decision-making in grid operations and market planning. Data-Driven Risk Modeling for Medium Voltage Grid Reliability As a Data Consultant in the Power Flow Analysis Team at Alliander in 2023, I developed a framework to assess risk across medium voltage (MV) grid routes. We analyzed and ranked available data sources to create a scoring system that identified high-risk segments. I also built statistical models to quantify reliability threats and standardized model validation practices across teams. This work enabled consistent performance tracking and informed strategic decisions on grid maintenance and targeted sensor deployment. Your browser does not support the video tag. Carbon Impact Metrics Created tools to assess the carbon footprint of server clusters, influencing sustainability reporting.",
