Short-Term Scenario-Based Probabilistic Load Forecasting: A Data-Driven Approach Abdolrahman Khoshroua,b,1,∗, Eric J. Pauwelsa,2 aCentrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Science Park 123, 1098 XG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands bDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands Abstract Scenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have been explored extensively in the literature in recent years. The performance of such models evidently depends to a large extent on how diﬀerent input (temperature) scenarios are being generated. This paper proposes a generic framework for probabilistic load forecasting using an ensemble of regression trees. A major distinction of the current work is in using matrices as an alternative representation for quasi-periodic time series data. The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is then used herein to generate temperature scenarios in a robust and timely manner. The strength of our proposed method lies in its simplicity and robustness, in terms of the training window size, with no need for subsetting or thresholding to generate temperature scenarios. Furthermore, to systematically account for the non-linear interactions between diﬀerent variables, a new set of features is deﬁned: the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the predictors. The empirical case studies performed on the data from the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014-L) show that the proposed method outperforms the top two scenario-based models with a similar set-up.

Introduction In the energy transition era (transition from conventional to non-conventional energy sources), the balancing of the power grid has become more challenging. It is mostly due to the inherently intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RES), on the one hand, and shortcomings in bulk energy storage systems, on the other. The studies on probabilistic energy production and demand forecast have hence gained momentum, as they are highly valuable from both a technical and an economic point of view [18]. Generally speaking, load forecasting problems can be contemplated from two main perspectives: 1) time hori- zon; and 2)"

The time-interval of interest, which can vary from the next few seconds or minutes to a couple of months or even years, categorizes the load forecasting problems into four groups [18]. The future of a grid and its expansion in long run is studied in the context of long term load forecasting (LTLF). Moreover, balance sheet calculations, risk management, purchasing energy and price planning purposes are most relevant from a few weeks up to a few months in advance; that is where medium term load fore- casting (MTLF) techniques come into play. Short term load forecasting (STLF), as a dominant factor in electricity dispatching, scheduling and unit commitment, is mostly concerned with the load estimations for a few hours up to a few days ahead. Finally, very short term load forecasting (VSTLF) approaches are aimed to mitigate the possible mismatches between supply and demand, by generating highly accurate load prognoses for the coming half an hour or less.

Moreover, with the growing integration of weather-dependent and intermittent RES, diﬀerent lines of research on the energy systems data have emerged. These include issues such as data-driven outlier detection, pre-processing, incorporating the dependency between diﬀerent attributes, and so on demand further exploration. Load forecasting methodologies can typically be classiﬁed into two groups: statistical and machine learning (ML) based techniques. The major argument in favor of the statistical approaches is the interpretability of their results; noteworthy is that some expert knowledge is usually needed to (partially) guide the learning process. On the other hand, ML based approaches are more independent in the sense that the user interventions are mostly limited to hyper- parameter tuning. Such models are generally more robust, easy to reconﬁgure, user-friendly and successful in ad- dressing the non-linearity in the data. The major drawback of ML based methods, however, is that being a black box, it is often not clear how diﬀerent attributes have contributed to the ﬁnal results. A number of single-value and probabilistic load forecasting models using two diﬀerent statistical and ML based approaches are summarized below. Statistical approaches: Multiple linear regression (MLR) models are among the most fundamental and widely used models for both STLF and LTLF problems. Broadly speaking, such models are mostly aimed to learn a relationship between several explanatory variables and a dependent (target) variable. Typically, a goodness-of-ﬁt function is used to estimate the target variable (load) based on other explanatory attributes (such as historical load and temperature"

    "text": "data, calendar information or some interaction of them). The performance of such models, consequently, are only satisfactory if the dependent variables are well formulated based on explanatory variables. However, the most striking feature of such models is their need for some expert-knowledge to formulate the interaction between diﬀerent variables - namely the recency eﬀect, as it seems unworkable to incorporate the eﬀects between diﬀerent variables without some domain expertise. Usually, a large number of lagged temperature data are being used to account for the recency eﬀect (which leads to an increase of the parameter-space). A solid ground for applying MLR analysis to STLF is provided in [34]. To include in part the interactions between the variables, 24 separate family regression models (one model for every hour of the day) have repeatedly been deployed in the literature to generate the day-ahead load prognoses (see e.g., [35]). Nonetheless, an interesting ﬁnding in [39] is that using 24 separate models (one for every hour of the day) might not necessarily ensure outperformance of such models over one interaction model for all 24 hours. Another category of regression based models are semi-parametric additive models, which generally are designed to address the nonlinear relationships and serially correlated errors. Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, as a class of ARMA models, are well-suited to capture diﬀerent standard temporal structures in time series data. A family of such statistical models have been used numerously in the literature for time series forecasting problems, as they oﬀer a baseline regression-based approach to account for the recency eﬀect in the data. A comprehensive discussion on diﬀerent types of autoregressive models, such as ARMA, ARIMA and ARMAX models is presented in [32]. Exponential smoothing is another capable and eﬀective approach to systematically assimilate the recency eﬀect in the data, by assigning weights to the previous data points inside a certain window [22]. However, the major drawback of most statistical models lies in their need for a lot of hyper-parameter tuning; speciﬁc factors such as threshold sets, the choice of lag sets, and also capturing the time-varying structures of the coeﬃcients are crucial in the overall performance of the model. Furthermore, setting up a good ﬁt enlarges the parameter space, which brings about longer computation time and raises the concern of over-ﬁtting. To better accommodate the various non-linearity in the data, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) estimation algorithm is introduced in [44]. Machine learning approaches : Machine learning (ML) based approaches are in fact a number of more advanced sta- tistical methods for handling more complex regression and classiﬁcation problems. Support vector machines (SVM), artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy regression models, classiﬁcation and regression trees (CART), and k−nearest neighbours are among the most well-recognized ML based techniques. SVM is a powerful method for handling vari- ous regression and classiﬁcation problems by recognizing patterns and constructing nonlinear decision boundaries. A generic model for STLF problem using SVM is developed in [8]; the strength of this work lies in its"

    "text": "novel automatic feature selection algorithms and also the use of a particle swarm global optimization based technique to tweak the hyper-parameters. To enhance the performance of such models, diﬀerent clustering approaches (e.g., based on hour of the day) have been proposed in the literature to group the data ﬁrst, and apply an SVM model on each subset of data. In [14], an unsupervised self organizing map (SOM) is used for clustering the load proﬁles, ﬁrst; an SVM regression model, for each group, is then applied to estimate the daily load proﬁles. As mentioned before, failing to 2 incorporate the recency eﬀects in forecasting methodologies can lead to under performance. An SVM type hourly load forecasting model in [10] accounts for the recency eﬀects by including a couple of previous ambient temperature values (several hours) as input variables. Nevertheless, the performance of such models relies on a suitable kernel function and hyper-parameter settings. A new approach for choosing an optimal kernel function for an SVM based model is proposed in [9]. Furthermore, fuzzy logic models have been developed to address some limitations of the linear models such as vague relation between diﬀerent independent and dependent attributes, shortage in the number of observations, and error distribution veriﬁcation [11], [23]. Such models provides a means to better incorporate the recency and cross eﬀects in the data, and hence can outperform their corresponding MLR based counterpart mod- els [20]. Over the last few years, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) have seen an explosion of interest in various types of prediction, classiﬁcation and control applications across diﬀerent ﬁelds. Typically, ANN do not perform based on modelling the underlying relation between predictors and the target variable; a mapping mechanism is instead in place to assign inputs to a target variable. Diﬀerent variations of (hybrid) NN-based models for the STLF problems have been proposed [36], [41]. It is a common sense that no individual forecasting model is the best for all data sets. Therefore, it is highly appreciated to combine diﬀerent forecasts to reduce the overall risk of making poor decisions. In [31], forecast combinations or ensemble models are classiﬁed into homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble methods. In the former method, diﬀerent forecast series are obtained by varying the hyper-parameters, input data, input features, or output targets for the same algorithm. The latter method, however, combines a number of forecasts with the hope that diversity help improving the results. Some examples of the application of diﬀerent types of ensemble learning methods in energy forecasting tasks are presented in [4], [12], [27]. S. B. Taieb and R. J. Hyndman propose a robust component-wise gradient boosting model for STLF in [38]. The reported work incorporates diﬀerent non-parametric eﬀects such as calendar, temperature, lagged demand using an additive framework; it is done by considering a separate model for each hour of the day (24 diﬀerent models for a day). Furthermore, univariate penalized regression spline functions is used to account for the recency eﬀect in the data. However, caution should be exercised in"

    "text": "the application of most exponential smoothing models, as the performance heavily relies on the window-size and hyper-parameter tuning [38]. Scenario-based probabilistic load forecasting models, as a subcategory of homogeneous models, have been exercised extensively, in recent years. Among the various methods, feeding simulated temperature scenarios to a single-value load forecasting model is being commonly accepted by the industry for its simplicity and interpretability. There are mainly three practical and popular methods for generating temperature scenarios, namely ﬁxed-date, shifted- date, and bootstrap approaches. Nevertheless, these methods have mostly been used on an ad-hoc basis without being formally compared or quantitatively evaluated [43]. The performance of such models evidently depends to a great deal on how diﬀerent temperature scenarios are being generated. Addressing the issues such as outliers, or gradual drifts in the data is essential in developing an accurate model. Another challenge in load forecasting problems (especially, short term) is the incorporation of recency eﬀects of the data using time-varying models. The recency eﬀect refers to the continuous nature of electricity consumption - at any moment it depends on the weather conditions and accordingly load, prior to that [28]. In other words, it mostly reﬂects the lagging eﬀect associated with the thermal inertia of the buildings and facilities. In the literature, some heuristic, data-oriented lagging window of a couple hours, or subsetting of the data are typical approaches to incorporate the recency eﬀect [28], [39]. The major concern regarding such methods is the generalizability of the results, as, e.g., the window size or the threshold in the subsetting step can aﬀect the performance of the models drastically [44]. We herein propose two scenario-based probabilistic load forecasting models using an ensemble of regression trees. The contribution of this paper is as follow. • An important distinction of the current work is the use of matrices as an alternative representation of the data. The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is then used to generate temperature scenarios, in a robust and data-driven manner. • In the second model, we extend the ﬁrst one by adding the ﬁrst and the second derivatives of the non-deterministic attributes (temperature and historical load data). This was done to partially account for the recency eﬀects and interactions among the data. Unlike some family of time-varying models, our proposed approach is systematic, with no need for subsetting or thresholding the data. • The experiment results show that special enhancements can consequently be obtained using this new set of 3 features (Section 4). The rest of this paper is organized as follow. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to the data from the load fore- casting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2014-L). Section 3 is devoted to our methodol- ogy in this paper. A brief recapitulation of the Gradient Boosting method is presented, ﬁrst, followed by out proposed models for point forecasting.

The experimental results along with a comparison with the results of a number of benchmark models are presented in Section 4. We conclude this work in Section 5. 2. Data To make the results of the proposed models replicable and accordingly comparable with the benchmark models, a case study was constructed based on the data from the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Compe- tition 2014 (GEFCom2014-L). The participants had been asked to develop a short term probabilistic load forecasting model, with the forecasting horizon of one month. The publicly available data set consists of the hourly temperature values from 25 anonymous weather stations and the aggregated hourly load proﬁles; for detailed description of data and the competition instructions see [19]. The electricity consumption patterns are subject to a variety of factors, such as meteorological conditions, calendar information, season, working schedules, energy cost and economic activ- ities [30]. In the current work, however, consistent with the requirements in the GEFCom2014-L, only the temperature and the calendar information are considered as the available predictors (besides historic load proﬁles). Temperature is believed to be a major driving force behind the electricity demand; the non-linear eﬀect of the temperature to the electricity demand is hence at the center of our attention. The left panel of Figure 1 provides an overview of the typical electricity consumption proﬁles on daily basis. This ﬁgure aﬃrms that the consumption patterns diﬀer notably during the weekends from the weekdays. Interestingly enough, on Friday afternoons, the demand proﬁle gets close to the weekends, whereas, during the working hours, it is akin to other working days. Furthermore, the right panel in Figure 1, illustrates the evolution of daily load proﬁles in the year 2010; this ﬁgure was obtained by recasting the time series into a 24 × 365 matrix, where every column contains 24 hourly values for each daily proﬁle [24]. As expected, in spring and fall, where the temperature is moderate, electricity demand tends to be lower than any other time of the year (winter and summer times). It underscores the fact that electricity demand is driven by climate conditions (e.g., air conditioning usage), and also the lifestyle changes followed by that. This ﬁgure also highlights the non-linear relation between load and temperature throughout the year. In the literature, temperature is arguably the most dominant predictor of the load; however, in and of itself, it is not suﬃcient, for two main reasons: • Diurnal human activities: As it is seen in the left panel of Figure 1, the typical electricity demand behaviour changes throughout the week. These diurnal human activities are plainly not reﬂected in the temperature data. Figure 1: Left: Comparison of typical daily consumption patterns during the week. Right: An overall representation of the evolution of the load proﬁles throughout a year. 4 Figure 2: An overview of the evolution of the ﬁrst derivative of the temperature"

    "text": "(Left) and load (Right) proﬁles. • Recency and cross eﬀects: Even for similar days (weekends or weekdays), the trend of daily load proﬁles, corresponding to similar temperature data, might not be necessarily alike; the recency and cross eﬀects can play a vital role. For instance, the rise of temperature in early spring might not necessarily lead to high electricity consumption, in comparison with summer times, as people might appreciate the rise in outside temperature after a cold winter. This, of course, can deviate across diﬀerent seasons. Figure 2 illustrates an overview of the trend (ﬁrst derivative) changes of daily temperature and load proﬁles in 2010. These ﬁgures were obtained by taking the ﬁrst derivatives of daily temperature and load matrices. It is seen that, e.g., in early spring and summer time, with the rise of temperature, afternoon peak proﬁles start to disappear. Although, the overall relationship between load and temperature is clear; it is, however, non-trivial how to robustly address the non-linear eﬀect between temperature and load proﬁles. Experiment results in Section 4 aﬃrm that including the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the daily proﬁles can indeed enhance the performance of the forecasting model. The following section provides a brief to the ensemble of regression trees, followed by our proposed methodology for probabilistic STLF problem. 3. Methodology In the present work, we opt to use an ensemble of regression trees (Gradient Boosting method) to predict day-ahead load prognoses, with forecasting horizon of one month, given hourly temperature proﬁles, historical (or estimated) load proﬁles, and calendar information. A brief recapitulation of an ensemble of regression trees is ﬁrst provided in below. 3.1. Ensemble of regression trees The use of “ensemble learning” methods in various classiﬁcation and regression problems has taken oﬀover the last few years. Ensembles generally rely on “resampling” techniques to obtain diﬀerent training sets for each individual regression or classiﬁcation model. Two popular methods for creating accurate ensembles are bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) and Boosting. In Bagging method, the training data for each individual model is drawn randomly, i.e., n instances with replacement- where n is the number of observations in the training set. In other words, successive members (e.g., trees or neural networks) in this method are independent of each other; since each member of the ensemble is trained individually using a bootstrap sample of the data set [5]. In other words, Bagging methods control the generalization error through perturbation and averaging of sub-models. Worth noting that in this approach, to ensure that every training sample is predicted at least a few times, the number of trees needs to be large enough. Since the trees are independent of each other, the distribution function and the quantiles of each hourly forecast can be easily computed based on the output of all the trees [40]. In Gradient Boosting method, however, the training set for each member of the ensemble depends on the per- formance of the previous model(s). More precisely, in order to alleviate the error in earlier models, extra weights"

A comprehensive evaluation of both these techniques on 23 data sets, using two popular classiﬁers, i.e., decision trees and neural networks is presented in [33]. The applicability of Gradient Boosting method in quantile regression load forecasting application have been put into practice in [38, 40]. A brief recapitulation of the Gradient Boosting method, as the main methodology used herein to predict the hourly load values, is provided in below. The goal in every typical prediction problem is to determine an estimate or approximation ˆF(x), of the true map- ping function F∗(x) which assigns a y ∈R to any given set of covariates x ∈Rp. This process is optimized by minimizing the expected value of some speciﬁed loss function L(y, F(x)) over the set of the joint distribution of all {y, x} pairs. In mathematical parlance, we have: F∗(x) = arg min F(x) Ey,xL(y, F(x)) = arg min F(x) Ex[Ey(L(y, F(x)))|x] (1) where E(.) is the expectation operator, and L(y, F(x)) is a loss function, e.g., the popular choice of squared-error {y −F(x)}2, for regression problems. F(x) is a member of “additive” class of functions of the form: F(x; {λk, ak}K 1 ) = K X k=1 λkh(x; ak). (2) where K is the number of members of the ensemble model, λk is the coeﬃcient of the additive model, the generic Algorithm 1: The Gradient Boosting Algorithm, with an squared-error loss function, in a nutshell. Initialization: F0(x) = ¯y for k=1 to K do ˜yi = yi −Fk−1(xi), i ∈[1 : N] (ρk, ak) = arg min ρ,a NP i=1 [ ˜yi −ρ h(xi; a)]2 Fk(x) = Fk−1(x) + ρkh(x; ak) end function h(x; a) in (2) is called a weak learner or base learner-it is usually a simple parameterized function of the explanatory variables, speciﬁed by parameters a = {a1, a2, . . .}. In the present work, each h(x; ak) is a small regression tree as introduced in [7]. For a regression tree the parameters ak are the splitting variables, split locations and means of the terminal node of the individual trees. An overview of the Gradient Boosting algorithm, with an squared-error loss function is presented in Algorithm 1, where the multiplier ρk is given by the line search: ρk = arg min Ey,xL(y, Fk−1(x) −ρgk(x)) ρ , (3) and gk(x) = Ey \"∂L(y, F(x)) ∂F(x) # F(x)=Fk−1(x) . (4) The rationale underpinning the choice of the ensemble of the trees is their ability in better handling the hetero- geneous input data–which comprise both continuous and discrete variables. Additionally, tree models are eﬀective, adaptive and modular, in that new predictors can be easily added. It is perceived that ensemble models, unlike their other ML based counterparts, are less prone to overﬁtting; they promise to strike a good trade-oﬀbetween bias and variance [6]. 3.2.

Time series data in smart energy systems often comprise more than one distinct time scales. There are some conspicuous diurnal patterns in the data, reﬂecting typical patterns for daily or weekly human activities. Furthermore, the overall structure of the data is aﬀected by a combination of those fast diurnal patterns superimposed on slower seasonal variations [24]. We herein consider two Gradient Boosting based methods to predict the day-ahead load prognoses. In the ﬁrst model, only calendar information, temperature data along with the historical load data are the input variables. We proceed further in the second model to incorporate the daily dynamics of the temperature and load proﬁles. It is done using the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the daily proﬁles. As it was principled in [19] the forecasting horizon is one month, therefore, the estimated values for the ﬁrst week of the month are being used to estimate the load proﬁles in the second week of the month and so on. In all cases, the aim is to predict L(d), 24 hourly load values for the target day d. Power consumption is subject to a wide range of exogenous variables, including calendar eﬀects, electricity price and so on. In the literature, the previous consumption patterns and calendar information have been extensively used in developing various load forecasting models. However, accounting for the interaction between diﬀerent variables, namely the recency and cross eﬀects can be an onerous task; it demands some domain expertise to be done sensibly [28, 39]. A number of common deterministic (categorical) explanatory variables used in our methodologies are as follows: month of the year mn ∈{1, 2, . . . , 12}, day of the week wk ∈{1, 2, . . . , 7} (starting from Sunday=1), and hour of the day hr ∈{1, 2, . . . , 24}.

Model I: The ﬁrst model provides us with a benchmark to measure the credibility of our proposed method in incor- porating the recency and cross eﬀects in the data in Model II. Here, we introduce six diﬀerent attributes to predict the hourly load values on the target day d. The three above mentioned common discrete (categorical) values, namely, mn, wk, hr, along with the (estimated) load value for a given hour on a day or a week before (L(d −1) and L(d −7), respectively). The intuition for this choice is the reﬂection of diurnal and weekly human activities on electricity con- sumption (Figure 1). The last covariate T(d) is the hourly temperature forecast for the target day d. As it it explained in Section 3.3, we generate one hundred independent temperature proﬁles, using the singular value decomposition, to correspondingly obtain 100 independent load forecasts for each target day; the combination of these forecasts are then used to obtain the load quantiles for each hour. Model II: To reﬂect the lagging eﬀect of temperature on load changes, in the second model, we add the daily dynam- ics of the temperature and load proﬁles (1st and 2nd derivatives) [24], [25]. For a given hour slot h the corresponding ﬁrst derivative of the variable z ∈{L, T} can be obtained by z′(h) = 0.5[z(h + 1) −z(h −1)]; with obvious analogues for the 2nd derivative.

The reasoning for doing so is that oftentimes the actual val- ues are not as important as the general underlying trends captured by the ﬁrst or second derivatives of the covariates. In other words, load value at any moment is inﬂuenced by the variations of the other attributes (namely, temperature proﬁles) prior to that moment. Including the derivatives is, in fact, a relatively simple and generic means to account for the recency eﬀect in the data. In comparison with most time-varying models, where the data is typically divided into subsets (based on thresholds), or a lagging window is optimized, our proposed approach is"

    "text": "more straightforward and user-friendly. Figure 3 provides a comparison of the importance of the predictors used to train Model I and II. The importance was determined by summing up all the estimates over all weak learners in the ensemble [3]. Predictor with the highest value is the most important one. The bottom panel of Figure 3 highlights the fact that including the derivatives (especially the second derivatives) can indeed be helpful. As it become clear in Section 4, to predict the load values for every month of the year 2011, we train a new model using all the available data up to the beginning of that month (rolling window mechanism). Each shade of color in Figure 3, hence, corresponds to one experiment (dark blue on the left is for January 2011, and yellow, on the right for December 2011). A major contribution herein is the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) to generate temperature scenarios T(d) for the target day d; it is done to determine the distribution (99 percentiles) of the load proﬁle in our proposed probabilistic forecasting models. A brief recapitulation to the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is provided in below. 8 3.3. Singular value decomposition As mentioned before, time series data in energy systems usually comprises at least two distinct time scales. Recasting such quasi-periodic time series as a matrix such that each column represents the values for a single day, could be helpful in gaining a better understanding of the data. The advantage of this approach is twofold. Primarily, representing a matrix as an image provides a thorough overview of the evolution of data in a certain time span; it hence can lead to better appreciation of indistinct or subtle features. Second, it makes it possible to draw on numerically stable matrix decomposition methods, such as SVD to elucidate the underlying data structure [24]. The SVD technique is used herein to generate new temperature proﬁles (matrices). To be more precise, we recast one year’s worth of hourly temperature values as a matrix T ∈R24×365 such that every column corresponds to 24 hourly values of a day. Consequently, the matrix T can conveniently be represented by a low-rank approximation. More speciﬁcally, given any arbitrary matrix A ∈Rh×d, there exist orthogonal matrices U ∈Rh×h and V ∈Rd×d (both with orthonormal columns) such that: A = USVT = rX k=1 σkukvT k (5) where S is a diagonal matrix of the singular values σk, such that its non-zero elements σ1 ≥σ2 ≥. . . ≥σr ≥0 are positioned uniquely, in a descending order, on the main diagonal (S has the same size as A and r = min{h, d}). Furthermore, uk and vk, called the left and right singular vectors, denote the kth column of U and V, respectively [37]. If there are only a few dominant singular values (as it is the case for the temperature matrices, in Figure 4), the expansion of the matrix in (5) can be suﬃciently truncated after just the ﬁrst few"

(6) To elaborate more, Figure 5 illustrates the ﬁrst three columns of uk (left) and vk (right) for temperature matrix for the year 2009. In geometrical terms, uk columns can be interpreted as the fundamental daily proﬁle and its successive increments; vk values represent the corresponding scaling factors for each uk proﬁles for each day. In other words, SVD decomposes the original time series into a linear combination of a number of (data-driven) orthonormal proﬁles, speciﬁed by uk columns; each proﬁle is then scaled up (or down) according to their corresponding weights in vk. For instance, u1 in the top left panel of Figure 5 strikingly resembles the averaged daily temperature proﬁle. Moreover, its corresponding v1 proﬁle (top right panel) outlines the evolution of that proﬁle throughout the year; it is in agreement with the fact that temperature is higher in summer time (middle part of the graph). Recall that these proﬁles are weighted based on the magnitude of their corresponding singular values which are sorted in descending order from left to right (Figure 4). The most dominant “corrective” incremental proﬁle u2 and its corresponding coeﬃcients v2 are displayed in the middle panel of Figure 5. This correction hence needs to be added to the ﬁrst proﬁle to get a better approximation, i.e., K = 2 in (6). Similar interpretations are valid for the third proﬁle (bottom panels) and so on. It is worth noting that vk proﬁles on the right-hand side of Figure 5 imply a distinct impression that temperatures are 5 10 15 20 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 Temperature: singular values 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Figure 4: The evolution of the singular values of the temperature matrices over the years; it suggests that a reconstruction of rank-4 approximation would suﬃce, indicating that temperature is quite regular. 9 5 10 15 20 0.2 0.22 U1 100 200 300 0.02 0.04 0.06 V 1 5 10 15 20 -0.2 0 0.2 U2 100 200 300 -0.1 0 0.1 V 2 5 10 15 20 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 U3 100 200 300 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 V 3 Figure 5: SVD-based decomposition of hourly temperature data for 2009.

In the following Section, SVD is practiced to simulate pragmatic temperature scenarios, in a systematic and data-driven manner. The generated proﬁles are accordingly fed to Models I and II to obtain the probability distribution (99 quantiles) of the load values for every given hour. 3.4. Temperature scenario generation A common approach in probabilistic load forecasting problems is to vary the input (e.g., temperature proﬁles) to obtain a series of forecasts and combine them. One of the major challenges, however, is how to create realistic temperature"

    "text": "proﬁles, as e.g., simply adding independent Gaussian noise to the hourly values of individual temperature curves results in some preposterously jagged proﬁles. In the literature, a number of solutions have been proposed to simulate temperature scenarios. In [42], it is proposed to combine diﬀerent weather station measurements to generate new temperature proﬁles. Nonetheless, it can be argued that normal weather scenarios cannot precisely be simulated by averaging the temperature proﬁles, as they tend to underestimate the peaks. Furthermore, such approaches are not resilient toward outliers, as even one instance can change the whole proﬁle as long as it takes part in generating new temperature scenarios; the performance of the forecasting model can consequently be diminished as a result of that. Worth noting that shifting the temperature data by one, two or even three days was initially used to generate temperature scenarios; it was later abandoned for obvious reasons. Some cumbersome approaches in terms of computational costs, such as Monte Carlo based methods are also popular, especially among utilities, to simulate thousands of temperature proﬁles - an approach which is used in scenario analysis in LTLF problems [21]. In [44], new temperature scenarios are generated, again, by averaging the temperature of stations 3 and 9 (GEFCom2014-L data was used). The reason for that is mentioned to be due to the existence of a good in-sample ﬁt with a cubic relation between the temperature records of those two stations and the load data. Besides pre-processing there are not a lot of solutions in the literature on how to generate robust and pragmatic input (temperature) scenarios. We herein propose a generic, data-driven and computationally eﬃcient SVD-based approach for simulating tem- perature scenarios. SVD allows us to create hundreds of sensible and realistic temperature proﬁles for any target day d, in a fairly fast and robust manner. Figure 4 aﬃrms the fact that the singular values σk of the temperature matrices over the years have not changed much; similar conclusions can be drawn for the left singular vectors uk. Furthermore, it is plain to see in Figure 5 that the vk coeﬃcients implicate the variability of the temperature proﬁles throughout the year.

We, therefore, proceed with the following steps, to create temperature scenarios: 1. In the ﬁrst step, we estimate the corresponding standard deviation sk for a number of right singular vectors vk (v2, . . . , v4). Figure 6 illustrates the histogram for v2, which shows that s2 ≈0.18.

Next, for any given day d of the test month, for which a number of temperature scenarios are desired, we take the actual temperature proﬁle for that day T = T(d), ﬁnd the corresponding vk coeﬃcients (v0 2, v0 3, v0 4); then blend them with zero-mean Gaussian noise: vn k = v0 k + N(0, ϵ2). These perturbed vk coeﬃcients are then used to generate a new (noisy) temperature scenario (reconstruct the matrix). 3. According to the scheme outlined above, for each actual daily proﬁle T(d), a hundred temperature scenarios are being generated. This new data set is then fed into the proposed prediction models; in the end, the forecasts are duly compared to the real load values. This enables us to determine the distribution of the hourly load values (99 quantiles) and compute the corresponding pinball error values (Section 4). Figure 7 illustrates an example of one hundred generated temperature proﬁles (Left), and their corresponding daily load proﬁles (Right). 4. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that v1 is left unperturbed as this is a proxy of the average temperature on a particular day, for which the uncertainty is negligible. Similarly, there is not much to be gained from perturbing other right singular vectors (v5 etc), as their impact on the proﬁle is insigniﬁcant (their corresponding σk are small). In [25], a preliminary study was done to investigate how the eﬀect of the perturbation variance in temperature proﬁles T(d) propagates into uncertainty on the target load proﬁle L(d). 4. Experimental Results Probabilistic forecasts can provide more comprehensive information about future uncertainties that what point forecasts can do [18]. As previously mentioned, the aim of the GEFCom2014-L was to estimate the quantiles of the hourly load values for a utility in the US, on a rolling basis [19]; the forecasting horizon was one month. Furthermore, it was expected from the contestants to investigate the weather scenario generation methods for probabilistic load forecasting. The scenario-based probabilistic forecasting methodology proposed by [21] was used by two top 8 teams (Jingrui Xie, top 3; Bidong Liu, top 8) in GEFCom2014-L. Therefore, we opt to compare our results with similar works. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) estimation based method is proposed in [44] for probabilistic load forecasting. This work is reported to outperform the methodology used by Bidong Liu to win a top 8 place in GEFCom2014-L. We hence have considered the proposed method in [44] as one of the benchmark models. 11 10-Jan 11-Jan 12-Jan 13-Jan 14-Jan 15-Jan 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 10-Jan 11-Jan 12-Jan 13-Jan 14-Jan 15-Jan 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 Figure 7: An illustrative example of 100 generated temperature scenarios for each day and their corresponding daily load proﬁles (obtained by Model II) for January 10-15, 2011.

The time series of interest are accordingly modeled for i ∈D as follow: Yi,t = φi,0(t) + X j∈D X c∈Ci,j X k∈Ii,j,c φi, j,c,k(t) max{Yj,t−k, c} + ϵi,t (7) where φi,0 are the time-varying intercepts and φi, j,c,k are time-varying autoregressive coeﬃcients. Furthermore, Ci, j are the set of all considered thresholds for the load and temperature data (all set manually). Ii,j,c are the index sets of the corresponding lags and ϵi,t is the error term. The modelling process is done in three parts: 1) choice of thresholds Ci,j; 2) choice of lag sets Ii,j,c; and 3) time-varying structure of the coeﬃcients. For further details see [44]. Another winning team (top 3) in the GEFCom2014-L was Jingrui Xie, who developed an integrated solution for probabilistic load forecasting [42]. Her proposed methodology consists of three parts: 1) pre-processing, which in- cludes data cleaning and temperature station selection; 2) forecasting (which focuses on the development of point forecasting models), forecast combination, and temperature scenario generation; and 3) post-processing, which em- bodies the residual simulation for probabilistic forecasting purposes. Inspired by the Vanilla model in [28], their core forecasting model is as follow: Lt = β0 + β1Trendt + β2Tt + β3T 2 t + β4T 3 t + β5Montht + β6Weekdayt + β7Hourst + β8HourstWeekdayt+ β9TtMontht + β10T 2 t Montht + β11T 3 t Montht + β12TtHourt + β13T 2 t Hourt + β14T 3 t Hourt (8) It is in fact a multiple linear regression (MLR) model with the following main and cross eﬀects: • Main eﬀects: a chronological Trendt variable, ﬁrst to third order polynomials of the temperature (Tt, T 2 t , T 3 t ), and a number of categorical variables namely, Month, weekday, and Hour. • Cross eﬀects: similar to [28], the cross eﬀects are incorporated using the multiplications of diﬀerent attributes such as HourtWeekdayt, TtMontht, T 2 t Montht, T 3 t Montht, TtHourt, T 2 t Hourt, and T 3 t Hourt. In the next step, the residuals obtained from (8) is modeled using four diﬀerent techniques, namely unobserved component models (UCM), exponential smoothing models (ESM), three-layer feedforward neural network (NN), and autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA). Four diﬀerent sets of point forecasts are accordingly generated by adding each set of residuals to the values obtained from the previous stage.

In the end, 10 diﬀerent temperature scenarios are generated according to [21], to obtain the 99 percentiles from the 10 point forecasts. The regression-based models are arguably vulnerable towards outliers, especially in the scenario based applica- tions. Due to the recency eﬀects, outliers, e.g., in temperature scenarios, can aﬀect the load forecasts for a longer time span. Our proposed SVD-based model is more robust and capable of handling this issue. As mentioned before, for every hour of the target day L(d), we obtain 100 diﬀerent load values (right panel in Figure 7). The results are then being used to determine the distribution of the hourly load values (99 diﬀerent quantiles) for any given hour by employing linear extrapolations [26]. An illustrative example of the predicted quantiles for 11 days, March 20-30, 2011, is provided in Figure 8. Pinball loss is a comprehensive index to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and calibration of the forecasts. It is an extensively used error measure for quantile forecasts in probabilistic forecasting problems.

The results in Table 2, together with Figure 3 highlights the fact that including the derivatives (especially the 2nd derivatives) is indeed helpful in enhancing the performance of the forecasting model. To investigate further, Figure 9 contains the Diebold-Mariano test [17], [13] to determine whether two models are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. These results were obtained by comparing the error between the median (q = 0.5) of the forecasts from two models and the actual values. The results are the average of 100 iterations, calculated according to (10). Suppose that the signiﬁcance level of the test is α = 0.05. For a two-tailed test, therefore, the upper and lower tails would each be 0.025. Accordingly, the upper and lower z−values are 1.96 and −1.96, respectively [1]. The null hypothesis of no diﬀerence between the two models (forecasts) will be rejected if the computed Diebold- Mariano statistic falls outside the range of [-1.96 , 1.96]. Consistent with the results in Table 2, in February, June and September 2011, Models I and II are most signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. On the other hands, in August, where both models have the highest pinball score, the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test is low. Finally, DM tests in May and November 2011, are negative, as Model I outperforms Model II. We use the Diebold-Mariano test to determine whether forecasts are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Let ei1 and ei2 be the residuals for Model I and II, respectively (i ∈[1 : n]). n is the number of 14 data points, and k is the lagging variable [2]. di = |ei1|2 −|ei2|2 ¯d = 1 n n X i=1 di γk = 1 n n X i=k+1 (di −¯d)(di−k −¯d), n > k ≥1 DM = ¯d s [γ0 + 2 h−1 P k=1 γk]/n , h ≥1 (10) 5. Conclusions This paper proposes two generic scenario-based probabilistic load forecasting models using an ensemble of re- gression trees. An important distinction of the current work is in recasting quasi-periodic time series data as matrices. The singular value decomposition technique is then used to generate temperature scenarios, in a robust and data-driven manner. In the second model, we extend the ﬁrst one by adding the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the non-deterministic attributes (temperature and historical load data). It was done to partially account for the recency eﬀects and interac- tions among the data.

On the one hand there are patterns linked to daily human activities. On the other hand, there are relatively slow trends linked to seasonal variations. In this paper we interpret these time series as matrices, to be visualized as images. This approach has two advantages: First of all, interpreting such time series as images enables one to visually integrate across the image and makes it therefore easier to spot subtle or faint features. Second, the matrix interpretation also grants elucidation of the underlying structure using well- established matrix decomposition methods. We will illustrate both these aspects for data obtained from the German day-ahead market. Index Terms—Data analysis, Data preprocessing, Renewable energy sources, Smart grids, Time series analysis. I. INTRODUCTION In smart energy systems, time series often show two distinct time scales. On the one hand, the data exhibit strong diurnal patterns reﬂecting the daily (or weekly) rhythms of human activity. On the other hand, these relatively fast diurnal patterns are superimposed on slower seasonal variations that have a signiﬁcant impact on the overall evolution of the data. To improve the visualization and make it easier to spot correlations between variables, we propose to analyze these time series as matrices (to be visualized as images) where rows represent hour slots, whereas columns correspond to days. This approach has two advantages. First, visualizing such time series as images allows one to visually integrate across the image and makes it therefore easier to spot subtle or faint features. Second, one can draw on well-established matrix decomposition methods to elucidate underlying structure. In this paper we will discuss both these aspects in the context of data from the day-ahead market. II. DATA The day-ahead market is an exchange for short-term elec- tricity contracts where the tradings are driven by its partici- pants [1]. Fig. 1 illustrates various collected sets of data for the German day-ahead market in 2016. Day-ahead price and the traded quantity data were collected from [2]. We obtained the day-ahead solar and wind feed-in energy data from [3]. ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators [4], was the platform for downloading the day-ahead load forecast. Using the above-mentioned data, we will explore the in- ﬂuence of the daily ﬂuctuations of the predicted supply of renewable energy sources (RES), viz. wind and solar feed-in, on the realized electricity price dynamics. III. BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW Recently, the impact of variable generation on the electric- ity market has attracted a lot of attention. Denny et al.

Simulation results in this work imply that large increases in the interconnection capacities bring about a decrease in average price and its volatility in Ireland. Furthermore, the growing contribution of intermittent energy sources enforces the transmission grid extensions and ex- panding the cross-border interconnections capacities to ensure the grid stability. K. Schaber, F. Steinke, and T. Hamacher in [6] examine the viability of this approach and its effects, based on the projected wind and solar data until 2020. They conclude that grid expansion is, indeed, helpful in coping with externalities which come with the deployment of renewable energies. The positive outcomes of the substantial deployment of photovoltaic (PV) installations in Germany and Italy, and in particular, their role in daytime peak price drop have been discussed by K. Barnham, K. Knorr, and M. Mazzer in [7]. This work also reports the beneﬁts of the complementary nature of wind and PV resources in the UK. Continuing further with studying the inﬂuence of renewable energy sources (RES) in Germany, a preliminary study on the German day-ahead market has been carried out in [8]. In the reported work, N. Adaduldah, A. Dorsman, GJ. Franx, and P. Pottuijt have taken into account the priority that the German policies assign to renewables over fossil fuels in case of adequate supply. The authors reported the existence of convincing evidence for the impact of RES on the recent emergence of negative prices on the German day-ahead market. Inspired by the work in [9], the goal of the present work is to determine the inﬂuence of the variability of the wind and solar feed-in on the price variability in the day-ahead market. To this end we focus on the intra-day dynamics of price as characterized by its second derivative, as this peaks for sharp trend reversals. arXiv:1807.10120v1 [physics.soc-ph] 11 Jul 2018 Fig. 1. An overview of the German day-ahead market in 2016; each data point represents one hour slot. From top to bottom, the price, solar, wind, load, and the traded quantity. IV. METHODS: ANALYSING TIME SERIES AS IMAGES A. Motivation An alternative way of visualizing time series with diurnal patterns is as matrices [10]. Fig. 2 shows one year’s worth of data represented as a 24 × 366 matrix/image (recall that 2016 is a leap year). An important distinction of this new way of representation is that it allows us to visually integrate patterns across longer time spans, which results in higher discriminatory power. For instance, even a cursory glance at the data image for the traded quantity (Fig. 2, bottom) highlights the fact that there is a signiﬁcant correlation with solar (the eye-like horizontal shape seen in the 2nd panel from the top) as well as wind (the vertical stripes in the 3rd panel Fig. 2.

Finding peaks and valleys As mentioned before, the main scope of this work is to explore how the inherent variability of the supply by RES can affect the intra-day variability of the market. To address this problem, we have applied an additional transformation on the daily proﬁles of the quantities of interest (viz. price, load, traded quantity, solar and wind feed-in). More precisely, any of the above quantities (generically denoted by f) can be considered as a function of two variables: • time of day, hour slots 1 ≤h ≤24 • day of year, 1 ≤d ≤366 (2016 is a leap year!) Hence for such a function f(h, d), we can investigate the corresponding 2nd derivative with respect to the hour (intra- day); fhh ≡∂2f ∂h2 ≈f(h + 1) −2f(h) + f(h −1) h2 (1) Extreme values of this 2nd derivative capture peaks (i.e. local maxima for which fhh < 0 and extreme) or valleys (i.e. local minima for which fhh > 0 and extreme). An example is illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows the wind feed-in proﬁle (top) and its corresponding intra-day 2nd derivative proﬁle (bottom) on Nov. 18, 2016. We contend that comparing the evolution of the 2nd derivative proﬁles (intra-day wise) can highlight the impact of the wind and solar energy feed-in on the price and also the traded quantity in 2016. Applying this intra-day 2nd derivative operator to all ﬁve quantities of interest and re-visualising the resulting time series as images highlights some interesting features of the data. As an illustration, Fig. 4 shows the 2nd derivative for both solar (top) and wind feed-in (bottom). In the top panel the gradual shift of sunrise and sunset over the seasons is clearly visible. Moreover, close inspection of this ﬁgure also reveals the dates of the switch to daylight saving summer time (days 87 and 304). The image for the wind feed-in is also interesting. As expected, wind values are more erratic and less seasonally determined. That being said, there is an undeniable “eye-like” shape that faintly mirrors the intra-day wind activities (see, e.g., [11]). Fig. 3. Wind proﬁle and its corresponding intra-day 2nd derivative on Nov. 18, 2016. Every sag in the lower proﬁle corresponds to a swell in upper and vice versa. C. Using SVD to highlight structure Another advantage of representing the time series as ma- trices is the possibility of using the matrix decomposition techniques to analyze the structure of the data. In this paper we will focus on the well-known singular value decomposition (SVD) method which states that an arbitrary h × d matrix A of rank r ≤min(h, d) can be factored as: A = USV T = r X k=1 σkUkV T k (2) where U ∈O(h) and V ∈O(d) are orthonormal matrices, (with Uk and Vk denoting the kth column of U and V , respectively) and S is an"

Top: Solar feed-in (intra-day 2nd derivative). The colour coding (in yellow) clearly highlights the change in sunrise and sunset times, creating an overall “eye-like” structure. Bottom: Wind feed-in (intra-day 2nd derivative). As expected, wind feed-in is much more erratic. Interestingly enough, this ﬁgure shows a vague but undeniable outline of an eye-like contour which mirrors the intra-day wind activities. strictly positive elements σk (so-called singular values) are placed on the main diagonal (see [12]). The importance of this decomposition lies in the fact that truncating the expansion in the right hand side of (2) after the pth term yields the best approximation of the original matrix A by a matrix of (lower) rank p (see [13]). Ap = arg min rank(R)=p ||A −R|| (3) where the norm || · || can be either the Frobenius or spectral L2 norm. Translating these results back to the original time series, we see that the columns of U ∈O(24) represent daily proﬁles, whereas the columns of V ∈O(366) furnish the corresponding amplitudes (one for each day). Fig. 5 shows a concrete illustration for the price data: the ﬁrst column U1 is depicted in the top panel and provides an overall daily proﬁle (obtained as a weighted average). The expected price peaks in the morning and early evening are clearly discernible. The corresponding amplitudes (one for each day) are given by the column V1 and shown in the 3rd panel. Some days with exceptionally low or high prices are clearly visible. A rank-1 approximation of the original time series would therefore be obtained by taking the averaged daily proﬁle U1 in the top panel and scaling it up or down using the 366 values in V1 (depicted in the third panel). Notice that in this ﬁrst approximation, each day has the same proﬁle, only the amplitudes change from one day to another. The values of U2 (depicted in panel 2) specify a ﬁrst correction to U1, with the corresponding amplitudes for this correction speciﬁed in V2 (displayed in panel 4). This correction means that for any day for which the corresponding V2 coefﬁcient is positive (almost every summer day) will have a lower price value between 11h and 18h than would have expected based on the (weighted) annual average U1. Adding additional terms in the SVD expansion improves the approximation. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 where the actual data for one typical day (18 Jan. Fig. 5. From top to bottom: The ﬁrst two panels are the ﬁrst (U1) and second (U2) dominant proﬁles of the price proﬁles in 2016; the third and the last one are their corresponding amplitudes (V1 and V2) throughout the year.

Structure-preserving smoothing As mentioned earlier, recasting the time series as images allows us to visually integrate subtle patterns in the data. Now, we indicate how the SVD factorization suggests a straightforward method to smooth the time-series in such a way that the overall structure is preserved. Recall that the V Fig. 7. An example of a smoothed V1 (corresponding to the most dominant singular value) used in reconstruction of the 2nd derivative of the price data. columns determine the amplitudes of every daily-proﬁle. By smoothing these proﬁles we eliminate most of the inter-day variation without affecting the overall structure. For the data at hand, the smoothing was based on robust local regression (RLOESS) but alternative approaches would be equally valid. The local regression smoothing method was used to alleviate the effect of outliers, while preserving the general trend in data. Fig. 7 shows an example of the smoothed V1 applied in the calculation of Ap. Using the smoothed version of the V vectors in the low rank reconstruction of data, yields the images depicted in Fig. 8. The panels in the left hand column show the original 2nd derivative proﬁles for the various quantities of interest (price, solar and wind feed-in, load and traded quantity). The two adjacent columns show the same data, but this time using two different smoothed, low-rank approximations: a rough rank-1 approximation (middle) and a much more accurate rank-7 approximation, which will be used in the regression analysis (Section V). In addition to appearing visually unbiased the choice for rank-7 is also based on the structural similarity index (SSIM), typically used for measur- ing image quality. SSIM assesses the deviation of Ap from the original matrix A by comparing their corresponding local means, standard deviations, and cross-covariance matrices. For detailed description, readers are referred to [14]. As can be seen in Fig. 9, in terms of SSIM, the approximations keep improving up till p = 7 after which it levels off. As a conse- quence, we select rank-7 as the appropriate approximation. It is worth noting that this ﬁgure is in line with our expectation regarding volatility of the various quantities: wind results in the lowest similarity, while solar feed-in agrees best with the approximation. V. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS After the lengthy methodology section we are now in a position to state some results. In order to shed light on how the price volatility could be linked to the volatility of other data of interest, we perform two pre-processing steps (discussed in detail in the previous section): 1) We compute the intra-day 2nd derivative which high- lights peaks and valleys (concavity/convexity as a notion of intra-day variability). 2) Next, we approximate these images using an SVD expansion up to rank 7. We call the resulting data Cp, Cl, Cq, Cs and Cw where each subscript refers to the corresponding quantity. Finally, we regress the price data Cp"

Clearly, the rank-7 reconstruction yields an acceptable approximation of the original images on the left. The regression was performed for three scenarios on untreated (original) and enhanced (smoothed) 2nd derivative data; using all data, using only day-time data, or using only night-time data. Table I contains the results for the case where the original data, A, were used. An improvement of the results was achieved by using the rank-7 reconstructed data, Ap, as is seen Fig. 9. The evolution of SSIM of the reconstructed matrix, Ap (for p = 1, ..., 24) from the original 2nd derivative matrix A. Thus rank-7 was considered an appropriate choice in our experiments. TABLE I.

Fig. 10 highlights the signiﬁcance of the obtained results of the later case in comparison with the randomized data (permutation test where, ﬁrst, the days of the year are shufﬂed, then the regression models were applied). High values of R2 for 24h and day time scenarios is an indicator of good performance of the model and emphasizes the fact that the concavity of the prices can indeed be modeled as a function of the concavity of other attributes, such as, load, traded quantity, solar and wind feed-in. These ﬁndings lead to a number of conclusions. The intra- day dynamics (concavity) of the price is least affected by the traded quantity on the day-ahead market. Moreover, RES have higher impact on the price dynamics than the load. During the day time, solar is the dominant"

In a similar way during night hours, wind can affect the price dynamics more than 20 times greater than the load. In latter case, however, the lower value of R2 points out to the fact that other measures are involved in the pricing mechanism at nights. Therefore, other attributes need to be determined to model the night time price dynamics in a more satisfactory fashion. VI. SUMMARY In this paper we have focused on time series in which a strong diurnal pattern is superimposed on slower seasonal variations. We have shown that it makes sense to visualize such time series as images/matrices, which can be approximated using low-rank SVD-based approximations. Furthermore, this decomposition suggests a natural structure-preserving smooth- ing of the data. We applied this decomposition to concavity Fig. 10. Permutation test to indicate the signiﬁcance of R2 values in all three scenarios which can be found in Table II. Each histogram is the result of randomization tests, repeated 1000 times (no. of bins = 20), where the days are shufﬂed before applying the regression models. data for price, load, traded quantity, solar and wind feed-in on the German day-ahead market (for 2016). This process of visualization suggested a linear regression model to unveil the impact of renewables on price.
