          <h3>Mr <i>M</i> — Majid's AI Assistant</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/majidkhoshrou/majidkhoshrou.github.io" target="_blank">Mr <i>M</i></a> is a custom-built AI assistant trained entirely on my own academic and professional materials — including research papers, personal website content, and relevant project documentation. Its goal is to make my expertise, background, and ongoing work easily accessible through natural language queries. All underlying data sources (HTML, PDFs, external links) are processed, cleaned, and embedded using <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=responses" target="_blank">OpenAI's models</a> and indexed via <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki" target="_blank">FAISS</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the major challenges in building Mr <i>M</i> was designing a robust pipeline that could unify information from diverse formats while preserving context fidelity. I implemented automatic text extraction, chunking with overlap, and semantic embedding, all wrapped in a context-restricted QA system to ensure trustworthy answers. The final result is an explainable, domain-specific AI system that can accurately respond to questions like "What are Majid’s latest projects?" or "Tell me about his academic research" — with traceability to the original sources.

          <h3>Improving Day-Ahead Load Forecasts Under Delayed Feedback — Alliander</h3>
          <p>
            Since June 2024, I've been part of the Short-Term Energy Forecasts (STEF) team at Alliander, where I focus on improving allocation forecasts for the day-ahead energy market. This wasn’t a typical forecasting problem — the target variable (Total Load) becomes available only in delayed stages: first after 3 days, then revised at 5 and 8 days, and finalized after 10 days. This delay made accurate training, evaluation, and monitoring significantly more complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            To tackle these challenges, I fixed long-standing bugs in the model pipeline, introduced features that better captured seasonality and holiday effects, and implemented a new concept we call <i>data balancing</i>. Instead of using an entire year of historical data, we now focus the training set on periods most relevant to the forecast horizon — improving signal quality and reducing noise. These improvements led to a 30% increase in forecast accuracy and are projected to save over €1.3 million annually. All enhancements have been contributed to <a href="https://github.com/OpenSTEF" target="_blank">OpenSTEF</a>, Alliander’s open-source forecasting library, supporting both internal teams and the wider energy forecasting community.

          <h3>Data-Driven Risk Modeling for Medium Voltage Grid Reliability — Alliander</h3>
          <p>
            From January 2023 to June 2024, I worked as a Data Expert in the Power Flow Analysis team at Alliander, where I led the development of a data-driven framework to assess risk across medium voltage (MV) grid routes. My main focus was to analyze capacity-related data and translate it into actionable insights that could support planning and operational decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key challenge was the absence of clear KPIs and a consistent definition of "risk" in MV networks, which made it difficult to prioritize interventions. I initiated and facilitated cross-functional discussions with stakeholders to align on a transparent risk score and identified measurable, widely available risk factors across the grid. The resulting model enabled systematic monitoring of grid vulnerability, informed more targeted maintenance and sensor deployment strategies, and helped establish a shared language around reliability risk across teams.

          <h3>Real-Time Unsupervised Motion Learning for AUVs</h3>
          <p>
            During my Master's studies at <a href="https://www.up.pt/feup/en/study/masters-degree/master-programmes/feup/22862/" target="_blank">FEUP</a>, I worked as a researcher at the <a href="https://c2sr.fe.up.pt/about-us/" target="_blank">C2SR</a> Lab, where I focused on adaptive motion planning for a coordinated fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operating in uncertain marine environments. My thesis introduced a real-time unsupervised learning framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), capable of incrementally estimating model parameters without needing a fixed number of clusters or a pre-existing dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm was deployed in a leader-follower fleet structure, enabling AUVs to dynamically adjust their formation in response to local variations in Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) measurements. By exchanging GMM parameters during coordinated resurfacing, the system evaluated distributional differences using variational distance and adapted its formation geometry accordingly—allowing it to zoom in on regions with high environmental variability. <a href="https://github.com/majidkhoshrou/AUV_Path_Planning_GMM" target="_blank">Extensive simulations</a> confirmed the method’s robustness and efficiency across both uniform and complex oceanographic conditions.
